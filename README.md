LIQA (Long-read Isoform Quantification and Analysis) is an Expectation-Maximization based statistical method to quantify isoform expression and detect differential alternative splicing (DAS) events using long-read RNA-seq data. LIQA incorporates base-pair quality score and isoform-specific read length information to assign different weights across reads instead of summarizing isoform-specific read counts directly. Moreover, LIQA can detect DAS events between conditions using isoform usage estimates.

## Inputs of LIQA
The input of LIQA is long-read RNA-seq read data in BAM format together with a reference isoform annotation file.
